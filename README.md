# SSHd-ag
> Simple SSH server with a single user and key-only access.

This docker container starts an [OpenSSH server](https://www.openssh.com/) exposing it.\
It is meant to be an alternative to chroot-ssh-server while creating SSH-tunnels.\
You will only be able to connect to it using ssh-key.

## Usage
* Clone this repository.
* Build the image.
```
docker build -t sshd-ag .

or

docker-compose create
```
* Run the service for the first time.
```
docker run \
  --name=sshd \
  -p 22:22 \
  -v /docker/volumes/sshd:/ssh \
  -e USER='buraco' \
  -e MOTD='Welcome to argallar.net's ssh-tunnel' \
sshd-ag

or

docker-compose up sshd
```
> Note you need to create `/docker/volumes` path in advance. Otherwise change `docker-compose.yml` or `docker run` command accordingly.
* Once service is started you will need a ssh-key to access the server. Generate it...
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "buraco's key"
```
* ...and put pubkey on `/docker/volumes/sshd/authorized_keys`.
